Simulated SOC investigation detecting a Windows brute-force attack using Wazuh SIEM and Sysmon logs mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;CK.

🛡️ SOC Investigation Report — Brute Force Attack Detected (Windows Host monitored by Wazuh)

1. Incident Summary

During security monitoring, multiple authentication failures were detected against a Windows 11 endpoint.
The activity matched a password brute-force attempt.

The alerts were generated by Wazuh SIEM using Windows Security logs (Event ID 4625).

2. Environment

- SIEM: Wazuh
- Endpoint: Windows 11 (Host machine)
- Log Source: Windows Security Event Logs + Sysmon
- Monitored User: "victim123"
- Hostname: "LAPTOP-EGEQKF5L"
- Agent: "windows-lab"

3. Detection Timeline

Stage 1 — Failed Login Attempts (Brute Force)

Wazuh detected multiple failed logins:

Event ID: 4625 — Logon Failure

- Failure reason: Bad password
- Logon Type: 2 (Interactive)
- Source IP: 127.0.0.1
- Target User: victim123
- Process: "C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"

This behavior indicates repeated password guessing attempts.

Stage 2 — Account Compromise

Multiple password failures 

- Account: victim123
- Logon Type: Interactive
- Authentication Package: Negotiate

This confirms the attacker eventually guessed the password.

4. Analyst Investigation

The activity was analyzed and correlated:

Evidence| Meaning
Multiple 4625 events| Password guessing attack
Same username targeted| Focused attack
Account compromise| No network IP
No network IP| Local or simulated attack

Conclusion:
Confirmed brute force attack

5. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

- T1110 — Brute Force
- T1078 — Valid Accounts (Initial Access)

6. Impact Assessment

The attacker obtained valid user access to the endpoint.
This could allow:

- Privilege escalation
- Persistence
- Data exfiltration
- Lateral movement

Severity: High

7. Recommended Remediation

- Reset compromised user password
- Enable account lockout policy
- Enforce strong password policy
- Enable MFA
- Monitor for lateral movement
- Block repeated login attempts

8. Final Verdict

This incident represents a successful brute-force attack resulting in unauthorized access.
